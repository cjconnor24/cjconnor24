### Hi there, my name is Chris 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿.

I am an ambitious, energetic, self-motivated software engineer. I have a genuine passion for technology and an appetite for learning and innovation. I enjoy all areas of development and I’m as happy working in *Javascript* as I am with *Java* or when designing *SQL* databases. I am seeking a challenging, Agile environment where I can learn, improve and develop as a software engineer.
